# Models

Some parts of CoV-Spectrum use very different data then the main application. An example is the analysis of wastewater samples. The code for these sorts of things is stored separately from the of the application in [src/models](/src/models). These "models" combine code that is normally found in [src/widgets](/src/widgets), [src/components](/src/components), [src/charts](/src/charts) and [src/services/api.ts](/src/services/api.ts). Note that models are not very strictly separated from the rest of the application.

See [./folders.md](./folders.md) for more information about the folder layout of CoV-Spectrum.
