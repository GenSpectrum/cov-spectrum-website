# Routing

This app uses [React router](https://reactrouter.com/) mostly in a typical way. There are a few cases where URL handling is special.

## Embed URLs

When widgets are shared and embedded, their props are encoded in URLs - see [./widgets.md](./widgets.md) for information about those URLs.

## `useExploreUrl` and `getFocusPageLink`

The central part of the application shows information about a specific SARS-CoV-2 variant. The selected variant and other filters (e.g. country) are stored in the URL.

Decoding or modifying these URLs can get relatively complicated. The `useExploreUrl` hook from [src/helpers/explore-url.ts](/src/helpers/explore-url.ts) handles this correctly for you.

To link to most pages in the application, the URL has to contain all of this information (e.g. variant selector). You should use `getFocusPageLink` to create these URLs.
