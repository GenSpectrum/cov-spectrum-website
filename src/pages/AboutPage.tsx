        CoV-Spectrum uses the{' '}
        <ExternalLink url='https://github.com/cevo-public/LAPIS'>LAPIS API</ExternalLink> to filter and

      <Question title='What is a variant?' id='faq-variant'>
        We distinguish between two ways to specify a variant. A variant can be defined as a clade on the
        phylogenetic tree. This approach is followed by the{' '}
        <ExternalLink url='https://cov-lineages.org/'>Pango lineages</ExternalLink>. Additionally, a variant
        can be defined as a set of (amino acid or nucleotide) mutations. On{' '}
        <ExternalLink url='https://covariants.org/'>CoVariants</ExternalLink> and{' '}
        <ExternalLink url='https://cov-lineages.org/global_report.html'>Cov-Lineages</ExternalLink> , you can
        find detailed information about variants that are currently of particular interest. Different to these
        websites, CoV-Spectrum does not only show pre-defined variants but provides tools to discover and
        analyze new variants.

      <Question title='Which data do you use?' id='faq-data-sources'>
        We offer two instances of CoV-Spectrum On{' '}
        <ExternalLink url='https://cov-spectrum.org'>cov-spectrum.org</ExternalLink>, we use genomic data from
        GISAID. On <ExternalLink url='https://open.cov-spectrum.org'>open.cov-spectrum.org</ExternalLink>, we
        use the data from GenBank which is fully open. The API that we use for the GenBank instance is openly

      <Question title='How can I search a variant?' id='faq-search-variants'>
        <p>
          CoV-Spectrum supports a wide range of search queries. The following sections presents search options
          of the basic search bar. For information on the <b>advanced search</b>, please read{' '}
          <InternalLink path='#advanced-search'>the question box below</InternalLink>.

        </div>
        <p>
          <b>Pango lineages:</b> You can search for a single Pango lineage (e.g., B.1.617) or include the
          sub-lineages by adding a "*" at the end (e.g., B.1.617*). The search is aware of Pango lineage
          aliases (i.e., B.1.617* includes B.1.617, B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, but also AY.1, AY.2, ...). It is
          possible to enter the "full name" instead of an alias (e.g., B.1.617.2.1 instead of AY.1).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Amino acid substitutions and deletions:</b> An amino acid (AA) mutation is encoded as the name of
          the gene, followed by a colon, optionally the base in the reference genome, the position on the
          amino acid sequence, and optionally the new base or a special character.

            <li>

              looking for sequences which has instead a Y at that position

      </Question>
      <Question title='How does the advanced search work?' id='advanced-search'>
        <p>
          The advanced search supports Boolean logic. Expressions can be connected with & (and), | (or) and !
          (not). Parentheses ( and ) can be used to define the order of the operations. Further, there is a
          special syntax to match sequences for which at least or exactly n out of a list of expressions are
          fulfilled.
