      <Question title='What is a variant?' id='faq-variant'>
        We distinguish between two ways to specify a variant. A variant can be defined as a clade on the
        phylogenetic tree. This approach is followed by the{' '}
        <ExternalLink url='https://cov-lineages.org/'>pangolin lineages</ExternalLink>. Additionally, a
        variant can be defined as a set of amino acid mutations. On{' '}
        <ExternalLink url='https://covariants.org/'>CoVariants</ExternalLink> and{' '}
        <ExternalLink url='https://cov-lineages.org/global_report.html'>PANGO lineages</ExternalLink> , you
        can find detailed information about variants that are currently of particular interest. Different to
        these websites, CoV-Spectrum does not only show pre-defined variants but provides tools to discover
        and analyze new variants.
      </Question>
      <Question title='Which data do you use?' id='faq-data-sources'>
        We use genomic data from GISAID and unreleased/not yet released sequences from the Swiss SARS-CoV-2
        Sequencing Consortium (S3C) complemented by metadata provided by the Federal Office of Public Health
        (FOPH) of Switzerland.
      </Question>
      <Question title='How can I search a variant?' id='faq-search-variants'>
        <p>
          CoV-Spectrum supports a wide range of search queries. First of all,{' '}
          <b>the search is case-insensitive</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Pango lineages:</b> You can search for a single pango lineage (e.g., B.1.617) or include the
          sub-lineages by adding a "*" at the end (e.g., B.1.617*). The search is aware of pango lineage
          aliases (i.e., B.1.617* includes B.1.617, B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, but also AY.1, AY.2, ...). It is
          possible to enter the "full name" instead of an alias (e.g., B.1.617.2.1 instead of AY.1).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Amino acid mutations:</b> An amino acid (AA) mutation is encoded as the name of the gene,
          followed by a colon, optionally the base in the reference genome, the position on the amino acid
          sequence, and optionally the new base or a special character.

        For Switzerland, we have some confidential data. The access can only be provided to very few people.

        then be embedded as an iframe. It will be automatically updated whenever new data arrives.

          The known variants are variants defined by the pangolin lineages. With the search (1), it is
          possible to search for a pangolin lineage. To include the sub-lineages of a pangolin lineage, write
          a "*" at the end. For example, "B.1.*" and "B.1*" will use all samples that were classified as "B.1"
          or as a pangolin lineage that starts with "B.1.".
        </p>
        <p>
          In (2), we show a preview of 12 known variants for the past three months with sequencing data.
          Currently, the first 8 are the WHO variants of concerns and are fixed for all countries. The
          remaining 4 are the variants with the most sequenced samples in the past 3 months. The proportion
          number in the preview plots (3) is the prevalence of the variant in the most recent 14 days for
          which sequencing data are available in the selected country.
